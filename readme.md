# Buddhilive Select

**Buddhilive Select** (aka BL Select) is a customizable web component that extends traditional select box with support for searching.

# Getting Started

To install **Buddhilive Select** straight forward without any JavaScript framework, just include the following script tag just before the "head" tag on your HTML page where you want to use the web component.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/buddhilive-select/latest/dist/buddhilive-select.js"></script>
```

Then to use this component, just use it like any other HTML element:

```
